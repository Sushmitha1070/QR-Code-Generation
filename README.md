# QR-Code-Generation

This project is a simple QR code generator that takes a user-provided URL, generates a QR code image for that URL, and saves both the URL and the QR code image to the local filesystem. The project utilizes Node.js and several npm packages to handle user input, QR code generation, and file operations.
